	This is a tiny project that i forked from activator-hello-kafka as a first step to interact with kafka 
	and twitter first, after that i am going to integrate it with spark-streaming and some nosql database 
	like mongodb and cassandra...
 
	The project uses sbt-pack to create some unix commands, so, before start running, make sure there is a kafka 
	broker, a mongo instance and a cassandra instance running in your local machine, i assure you that your 
	machine is going to need a lot of memory, like 16 GB at least, but there are not any memory leak, i think...

	

	TODO

	Integrate kafka with Twitter. DONE!
	Integrate with spark-streaming.DONE!
	Integrate with Mongo.DONE!
	Integrate with Cassandra.PENDING
